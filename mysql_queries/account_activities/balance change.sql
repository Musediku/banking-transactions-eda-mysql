/*
Mechanics:
This query computes the average, minimum, and maximum balance change 
by subtracting the old balance from the new balance for all transactions.  

Insight:
It provides a quick view of account activity intensity â€” showing whether accounts 
typically gain or lose money, and highlighting the extremes that may indicate 
outliers, unusual transactions, or errors.
